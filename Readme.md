# Minimum cost flow solving algorithms

## Database

The used database is a simple directory named *data*.

Read the details in *data/readme.md*.

## How to run

The applications is to be launched via a command line interface as specified below. There are currently no projects for a GUI.

```bash
java CLI [arguments]
```

Where arguments is one of the following:
* **-c (input instance ID) (input solution ID)**: Check if the solution file is a realisable solution for the instance file problem.
* **-r (algorithm) (input instance ID) (output solution ID)**: Runs an algorithm with the specified instance file and outputs the solution file.

Information about some arguments:
* **algorithm** is a string on the following list:
  * Todo
<!-- 
Adding to that, we have some optional arguments:
* **-mt (integer, default=3600))**: Optional arguments in -r mode. The specified integer is the maximum number of seconds to run the algorithm. -->
