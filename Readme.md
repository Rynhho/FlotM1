# Minimum cost flow solving algorithms

## How to run

The applications is to be launched via a command line interface as specified below. There are currently no projects for a GUI.

```bash
java CLI [arguments]
```

Where arguments is one of the following:
* **-c (input instance file) (input solution file)**: Check if the solution file is a realisable solution for the instance file problem.
* **-r (algorithm) (input instance file) (output solution file)**: Runs an algorithm with the specified instance file and outputs the solution file.

Information about some arguments:
* **algorithm** is a string on the following list:
  * Todo

Adding to that, we have some optional arguments:
* **-mt (integer, default=3600))**: Optional arguments in -r mode. The specified integer is the maximum number of seconds to run the algorithm.

## Implemented algorithms

## Features (maybe) coming later

- Specify a directory of instances to solve.
- Sepcify a directory of instances to check.
