# Network flow solving algorithms

## How to run

The applications are to be launched via a command line interface.

The available applications are detailed below.

### Run

Run launches a solving algorithm.

It has to be launched as following:

```bash
java Run [mandatory: algorithm] [optional: -mt (integer)]
```

Mandatory arguments:
* algorithm is a string on the following list:
  * Todo

Optional arguments:
* -mt (integer):
  * The specified integer is the maximum number of seconds to run the algorithm.

### Benchmark

Benchmark launches a benchmark on the chosen algorithm.

It has to be launched as following:

```bash
java Benchmark [mandatory: algorithm] [optional: -mt (integer)]
```

Mandatory arguments:
* algorithm is a string on the following list:
  * Todo

Optional arguments:
* -mt (integer):
  * The specified integer is the maximum number of seconds to run the algorithm.

## Implemented algorithms

## Roadmap

### First phase

Luis:
* Prepare packages, source directories, interfaces
* Readme

Others:
* Find book and start studying it.

### Second phase

Luis:
* Start report (LaTeX on overleaf)
* Help others

Lucas:
* Checker

Sylvain:
* Test script testing both generator and checker

Lin:
* Generator

### Third phase

Luis:
* Nothing lol

Everyone else:
* Implements algorithms
* Write respective algorithm into report

Lucas:

Sylvain:

Lin:

### Fourth phase

Luis:
* Benchmarks

Everyone else:
* Nothing lol
